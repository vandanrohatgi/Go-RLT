# Go-RLT
A rate limit testing tool written in GO

Recently I found the need to test if a server had rate limiting enabled or not? I decided that this was a pretty good opportunity to learn GO! 

So I wrote a really basic program in GO to do just that. It was able to make over 1000 requests in around 1 second! and that was without any threading! Just a simple for loop. Meanwhile, my good ol' Python program is still running as we speak.
